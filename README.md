# idea-remotegroovyconsole-server-portlet
Liferay portlet, incapsulating server for Remote Groovy Console IntelliJ IDEA plugin (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5373?pr=)

It allows you to execute Groovy scripts from IntelliJ IDEA remotely in Lifeay Portal.
GroovyConsoleServer does not support execution of selected part of script with attached imports - whole script is
always executed.

TODO:
 - create control panel portlet for configuration, start/stop functions
 - check lr6.0
 - maybe include liferay core classes in groovy consoles' default imports
